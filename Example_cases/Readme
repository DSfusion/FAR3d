The example in directory DIIID is an n = 1 RSAE instability from DIII-D. The example in directory ITER_NBI_Alpha is not complete yet.

**** INITIAL VALUE TIME EVOLUTION OPTION:

In the file Input_Model set matrix_out = .false. Then to run from this directory, type:

../../Source/xfar3d

The input files used here are:

Input_Model - main input file containing FAR3d options, physicsl paramters, mode selection, etc.
Eq_DIIID_RS - Equilibrium file containing magnetic field, geometry data (R,Z,Phi), and metric
              elements. These are all expressed in Boozer coordinates and are represetented in
	      FAR3d's pseudospectral form (finite difference grid in radius, Fourier series in
	      poloidal/toroidal angles (m*theta - n*zeta)
Data.txt, Data2.txt - These are two different versions of profile files. They contain profile
              information derived from TRANSP modeling of this particular discharge. Both will
	      work and give similar answers, but Data2.txt includes data on more profiles than
	      Data.txt
	      
After the run finishes, the main output is contained in the file farprt. This includes the input
      data, the evolution of energies in the different modes, and, at the end, the growth rates
      and real frequencies of the modes. For a well-converged linear run all varialble and modes
      should have close to the same growth rate (gam) and real frequency (om_r). Thes are
      normalized to the Alfven time (R_0/v_A0) at the magnetic axis. At the end of farprt
      the average of the growth rate and real frequency are calculated, based on averaging
      over all of the modes and dynamic variables. The standard deviation is also provided
      following the average. This information is also provided more compactly in the file
      temp_grwth_omega
      
      
**** EIGENSOLVER OPTION:
      
In the file Input_Model set matrix_out = .true. Then to run from this directory, type:

../../Source/xfar3d

This writes out non-zero elements of the two block tridiagonal matrices (a_matrix.dat and b_matrix.dat)
and the file jdqz.dat which contains the dimension data, the mode list and a flux surface list.
This is then followed by running the eigensolver:

../../Eigensolver/xEigen .076 .048
 
The command line arguments are real_frequency and growth rate (both normalized to Alfven time R_0/v_A0).
These are given to the code as a target for an eigenvalue search in the complex plane - it will find
seven eigenvalues that it judges to be close to the target. In this example we have specified a target
close to that found above by the initial value version of FAR3d. The screen output is as given below.
As expected, an unstable eigenvalue is found that is close to that found with the initial value version,
and out of the three growing modes found, this one has the highest growth rate. Each line beginning with
"lambda" is a separate eigenmode. This is followed by a line that gives an error metric, the inner product
with itself of the equation being solved (Ax = lambda Bx) where lambda is replaced by alpha/beta, where
alpha and beta are complex quantities and om_r = real(alpha/beta), gam = imag(alpha/beta).
