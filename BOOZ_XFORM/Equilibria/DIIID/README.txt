These VMEC and Boozer transform files (d3d_159243_00805) are the same as the earlier DIIID_RS files.
Also, the VMEC and Boozer transform output files (wout, threed1, boozmn and woutb) are provided for
this case along with the original EFIT equilibrium g-file and a dcon file. This case is based on
experiments reported in the papers Collins C. et al 2017 "Phase-space dependent critical gradient
behavior of fast-ion transport due to Alfvén eigenmodes," Nucl. Fusion 57 086005;
and Collins C. et al 2016 "Observation of critical-gradient behavior in Alfvén-eigenmode-induced
fast-ion transport," Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 095001. It was also the subject of a
code-validation/comparison study in the paper S. Taimourzadeh, E.M. Bass, Y. Chen, C. Collins,
et al., Nucl. Fusion 59 (2019) 066006.
