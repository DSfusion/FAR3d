(1) Compile/load the code init_value_run_plotter.f90 using the script bld_init_value_run_plotter
     (this requires the Plplot and the Visit Silo libraries,also the spline fit code bspline90_22_ver0.f90)
    Compile/load the code read_boozer_wout.f90 using the script bld_read_boozer_wout
     (this requires the LIBSTELL and Netcdf libraries)
    The above scripts and codes will need some modifications for each platform to indicate
      the library locations.

(2) Run code to generate R,Z coordinates from Boozer representation for 2D contour plot:

xbw_read d3d_176523_00615

  This produces the file geom_bzr_to_cyl.dat

(3) Run plotter:

xplot_init_value_run fs0000z 4

  This will plot the data read from the FAR3d dump file fs0000z.
  The 4 indicates that the variable that will be plotted (in this case 4 = fluctuating fast ion density)
  Other variable choices are:
    1 - fluctuating poloidal flux
    2 - potential
    3 - fluctuating thermal plasma pressure
    4 - fluctuating fast ion density
    5 - fluctuating fast ion parallel velocity moment
    6 - fluctuating thrermal plasma parallel velocity moment
    
   Defaults: if you just type: xplot_init_value_run it is assumeed that the
   dump file is fs0000z and the variable is 2 (potential)
   
   The code produces a Plplot x-y plot of the Fourier modes vs. radius. The
   user will be prompted with several choices of output format. Just hitting
   return will on most systems just make the plot on the screen.
   This code also produces a file 2D_phi.silo, 2d_nfast.silo, etc. with the
   name after the underscore corresponding to the variable that was selected.
   This is a 2D contour plot of the mode structure in R, Z coordinates using
   the data format (Silo) used by Visit. This may be plotted by using the
   Visit session (2D_mode_structure.session).
   
   
****Second option****

FAR3d also writes out the following text files that contain the Fourier amplitudes
vs. radius (the number of modes included is determined by the variable lplots in the
FAR3d Input file). These include the basic dynamic variables (phi, psi, uzt = vorticity,
vthprlf, pr, nf, vprlf) as well as magnetic field and flow velocity components that
have been derived from these variables (br, bth, vr, vth | r = radial, th = poloidal
angle). spctr_0000 contains the integrated kinetic and magnetic energy components in
each mode.

br_0000
phi_0000
psi_0000
uzt_0000
vr_0000
vthprlf_0000
bth_0000
nf_0000
pr_0000
spctr_0000
vprlf_0000
vth_0000
