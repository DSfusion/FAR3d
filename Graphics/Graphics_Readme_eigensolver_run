(1) Compile/load the code egn_plotter_jdqz_far3d.f90 using the script bld_plt_egn_jdqz_far3d
     (this requires the Plplot and the Visit Silo libraries,also the spline fit code bspline90_22_ver0.f90)
    Compile/load the code read_boozer_wout.f90 using the script bld_read_boozer_wout
     (this requires the LIBSTELL and Netcdf libraries)
    The above scripts and codes will need some modifications for each platform to indicate
      the library locations.

(2) As with the initial value version, run code to generate R,Z coordinates from Boozer
    representation for 2D contour plot:

xbw_read d3d_176523_00615

  This produces the file geom_bzr_to_cyl.dat. If this has already been done for this
  equilibrium the existing geom_bzr_to_cyl.dat file can be used.

(3) Run the plotter (the eigenvalue option of the code has a different plotter than
    the initial value code since it produces multiple eigenmodes for each run. The
    current version is set up to find 7 eigenmodes - this can be changed if needed)

xplot_egn_jdqz_far3d

  This will plot the data read from the FAR3d eigensolver files. It reads data from
  egn_values.dat, egn_mode_ascii.dat,and geom_bzr_to_cyl.dat. xplot_egn_jdqz_far3d is
  created from running the script bld_plt_egn_jdqz_far3d which compiles the source
  codes egn_plotter_jdqz_far3d.f90 and bspline90_22_ver0.f90
    
   Defaults: if you just type: xplot_egn_jdqz_far3d then the data from the above input
   files is read and the 7 eigenmode structures are plotted (4 per Plplot window).
   Each plot is labeled with its frequency and growth rate (in Alfven units, i.e.,
   normalized to v_A0/R_0). The plots show the different Fourier amplitudes vs.
   radius using different colors and the (m,n) of the dominant mode is indicated
   at the top of each plot.
   
   The code produces a Plplot x-y plot of the Fourier modes vs. radius. The
   user will be prompted with several choices of output format. Just hitting
   return will on most systems just make the plot on the screen.
   
   The user can then select a mode of particular interest out of the 7 plots for
   generating a 2D Visit silo file. To do this step, rerun the plotter with an
   integer following the executable name. For example "xplot_egn_jdqz_far3d 3".
   This would select out the 3rd eigenmode and create a 2D_jdqz_plot.silo file
   with the 2D mode structure in a format that can be read by Visit. It also
   creates a Plplot screen plot of that particular mode and outputs an egn_out.curve
   file that can be used with Visit to produce plots of the Fourier modes vs. radius
   similar to the Plplot plots.The advantage of plotting from egn_out.curve is that
   it adds labels indicating the (m,n) value of each curve.
